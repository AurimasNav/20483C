# Module 3: Developing the Code for a Graphical Application

## Lab: Writing the Code for the Grades Prototype Application

### Lab Setup

Estimated Time: **90 minutes**

### Preparation Steps

Ensure that you have cloned the 20483C directory from GitHub. It contains the code segments for this course's labs and demos. (**https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20483-Programming-in-C-Sharp/tree/master/Allfiles**)

### Exercise 1: Adding Navigation Logic to the Grades Prototype Application

#### Task 1: Examine the window and views in the application

1. Click **Visual Studio 2017**.
2. In **Visual Studio**, on the **File** menu, point to **Open**, and then click **Project/Solution**.
3. In the **Open Project** dialog box, browse to **[Repository Root]\Allfiles\Mod03\Labfiles\Starter\Exercise 1**, click **GradesPrototype.sln**, and then click **Open**.
   >**Note :** If any Security warning dialog box appears, clear **Ask me for every project in this solution** check box and then click **OK**.
4. On the **Build** menu, click **Build Solution**.
5. In **Solution Explorer**, expand **GradesPrototype**, and then double-click **MainWindow.xaml**.
6. Note that this is the main window for the application that will host the following views:
   - **LogonPage.xaml**
   - **StudentProfile.xaml**
   - **StudentsPage.xaml**
7. In **Solution Explorer**, expand **Views**, and then double-click **LogonPage.xaml**.
8. Notice that this view contains text boxes for the username and password, a check box to identify the user as a teacher, and a button to log on to the application.
9. In **Solution Explorer**, double-click **StudentProfile.xaml**.
10. Notice that this view contains a report card that currently displays a list of dummy grades. The view also contains a **Back** button and a blank space that will display the student’s name. This view is displayed when a student logs on or when a teacher views a student’s profile.
11. In **Solution Explorer**, double-click **StudentsPage.xaml**.
12. Notice that this view contains the list of students in a particular class. This view is displayed when a teacher logs on. A teacher can click a student’s name and the **Students Profile** view will be displayed, containing the selected student’s data.

        SessionContext.UserName = username.Text;
        SessionContext.UserRole = (bool)userrole.IsChecked ? Role.Teacher : Role.Student;

        // If the role is Student, set the CurrentStudent property in the global    context to a dummy student; Eric Gruber
        if (SessionContext.UserRole == Role.Student)
        {
            SessionContext.CurrentStudent = "Eric Gruber";
        }

        // Raise the LogonSuccess event
        if (LogonSuccess != null)
        {
            LogonSuccess(this, null);
        }
    }
    ```
7. In **Solution Explorer**, double-click **LogonPage.xaml**.
