28. Verify that the details for Jesper Herp are displayed.
29. On the **Debug** menu, click **Stop Debugging**.
30. Close Visual Studio.

## Lesson 2: Accessing Data by Using OData Connected Services

### Demonstration: Retrieving and Modifying Grade Data Remotely

#### Preparation Steps

1. Ensure that you have cloned the 20483C directory from GitHub. It contains the code segments for this course's labs and demos. (**https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20483-Programming-in-C-Sharp/tree/master/Allfiles**)
2. Initialize the database:
   - In the **Apps list**, click **File Explorer**.
   - In **File Explorer**, navigate to the **[Repository Root]\Allfiles\Mod08\Labfiles\Databases** folder, and then double-click **SetupSchoolGradesDB.cmd**.
    >**Note:** If a Windows protected your PC dialog appears, click **More info** and then click **Run Anyway**.
   - Close **File Explorer**.
3. Ensure that you have completed the following steps before starting working on this module:
   - Install **Microsoft.OData.ConnectedService.vsix** from **[Repository Root]\AllFiles\Assets**.
   - Install **WcfDataServices.exe** from **[Repository Root]\AllFiles\Assets**.
   - Run **WCF.reg** file from **[Repository Root]\AllFiles\Assets**.

#### Demonstration Steps

1. Open the **GradesPrototype.sln** solution from the **[Repository Root]\\Allfiles\\Mod08\\Labfiles\\Solution\\Exercise 3** folder.
    >**Note:** If any Security warning dialog box appears, clear **Ask me for every project in this solution** check box and then click **OK**.
2. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click **Solution ‘GradesPrototype’**, and then click **Properties**.
3. On the **Startup Project** page, click **Multiple startup projects**. Set **Grades.Web** and **GradesPrototype** to **Start**, and then click **OK**.
4. Rebuild the solution.
5. View the properties of the **Grades.Web** project and show the **Web** tab. Explain to the students that during Exercise 1, they will add this project to the solution and configure it as a data service.
6. In the **Grades.Web** project, in the **Services** folder, open **GradesWebDataService.svc**, and then explain to the students that during Exercise 1, they will set rules to indicate which entity sets and service operations are visible and add a new service operation to the class.
7. In **Solution Explorer**, in the **Grades.Web** project, view the **Connected Services** folder.
8. Explain to the students that in Exercise 2, they will add a **OData Connected Service** to the data service so that the data is retrieved from the data service, not directly from the data source.
9. In **Solution Explorer**, in the **GradesPrototype** project, view the **DataModel** folder.
10. Explain to the students that in Exercise 2, they will copy the partial classes from the original Entity Data Manager (EDM) into the client application because the partial types that are contained in them are not propagated by **OData Connected Service**.
11. In the **GradesPrototype** project, in the **Services** folder, in **SessionContext.cs**, locate the **DBContext** declaration.
12. Explain to the students that in Exercise 2, they will specify the URL of the **GradesWebDataService** data service here.
13. In the **Views** folder, expand **StudentsPage.xaml** and then open **StudentsPage.xaml.cs**, locate the **Refresh** method, and then explain to the students that in **Exercise 2**, they will use eager loading to load related data.
14. In the **Controls** folder, expand **AssignStudentDialog.xaml** and then open **AssignStudentDialog.xaml.cs**, locate the **Student_Click** method, and then explain to the students that in **Exercise 2**, they will add code to the application to detect when student data has been changed.
15. In **StudentsPage.xaml.cs**, locate the **ImageNameConverter** class, and then explain to the students that in Exercise 3, they will create this class and implement the **IValueConverter** interface.
16. In **StudentsPage.xaml**, point out the **UserControl.Resources** element and the **Image** element, and then explain to the students that in Exercise 3, they will bind **Image** controls to the images of students to display them in the UI.
17. Run the application, log on as **vallee** with a password of **password99**, and then point out to students that the students list now includes images.
18. View a student’s profile and point out that this also includes an image.
19. Remove a student from the class and then enroll that student again to show images in the **Assign Student** dialog box and for new students who are added to a class.
20. Click **Log off**, and then close the application.
21. On **Debug menu**, click **Stop Debugging** and then close Visual Studio.
